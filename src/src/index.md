## Notions

- `<this this>` denotes the formative (word) to which the affix in question is attached.
- `<this undecorated>` denotes the formative before attaching the affix in question.
- `<this context>` denotes the current semantic context, environment, or universe of discourse, which is described by the current formative and possibly other formatives.
- `<this another>` denotes another participant of `<this context>` distinct from `<this this>`.
- `<this attached>` denotes the connected semantic context, presupposition, events, or facts mentioned earlier or to be mentioned or assumed from `<this context>`.
- `<this speaker>` is the one who says the current text.

Roughly, <this this>THIS</this> corresponds to the current word, <this context>CONTEXT</this> to the current clause/sentence/case frame, and <this another>ANOTHER</this> to another noun in <this context>CONTEXT</this>. <this attached>ATTACHED</this> are usually previous sentences or a greater context that led to the current more narrow <this context>CONTEXT</this>.
