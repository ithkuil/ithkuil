# Notions

* `<this this>` denotes the formative (word) to which the affix in question is attached.
* `<this undecorated>` denotes the formative before attaching the affix in question.
* `<this context>` denotes the current semantic context, environment, or universe of discourse, which is described by the current formative and possibly other formatives.
* `<this another>` denotes another participant of `<this context>` distinct from `<this this>`.
* `<this attached>` denotes the connected semantic context, presupposition, events, or facts mentioned earlier or to be mentioned or assumed from `<this context>`.
* `<this speaker>` is the one who says the current text.

Roughly, `<this this>` corresponds to the current word, `<this context>` to the current clause/sentence/case frame, and `<this another>` to another noun in `<this context>`. `<this attached>` are usually previous sentences or a greater context that led to the current, more narrow `<this context>`.
