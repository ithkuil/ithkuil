- Sanction + Validation
- Mood
- Case + Register
- Relation
- Context
- Derivation: NA1, COO
- Aspect_A2
- Modality
- Derivation: others (some VxC suffixes might have exceptional precedence rules)
- Essence
- Perspective (except Unbounded, which is under the scope of Configuration/Affiliation)
- Valence
- Version
- Derivation??
- Aspect_A1 / Aspect_F / Aspect_AA
- Derivation??
- Phase
- Extension
- Configuration + Affiliation
- Function
- Root + Stem + Pattern + Designation + SSD
