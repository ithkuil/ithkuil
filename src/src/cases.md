# Cases

<lojban>It would be nice to find at least one preposition for each case (xe cukta, te fukpi etc. are too long in this regard whereas <jbo>xebe'i</jbo> and <jbo>veka'a</jbo> are yummy). But I'm not sure that the language has all the cases that we might need. Who knows, one may decide that we need 1342 cases. Now what? Its own preposition for each predicate place?</lojban>

## Transrelative cases

<description>Almost the half of languages of the world have [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative)-[Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive) structure. Another half has nominative-accusative structure. So two duads. It's interesting that [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) and [Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive) are not two parts of a duad in Ithkuil but instead just two cases among many others.</description>

### OBL Oblique

<description><this this>THIS</this> plays the role of content.</description>

> It's a present from my grandmother.

> This is what I want.

> The floor is made of stone ([Oblique](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#obl-oblique)).

### ERG Ergative

<description><this this>THIS</this> plays the role of agent.</description>

<description><this this>THIS</this> agent while having some will starts an act of <this context>CONTEXT</this> resulting in some change of properties in <this another>ANOTHER [Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive)</this>.</description>

> The dog bit the man.

> *[Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) bit the man.*

> The policeman forced the criminal to stop.

> *[Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) forced [Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive) to stop.*

<lojban><jbo>le gasnu</jbo>, <jbo>le zukte</jbo></lojban>

<lojban><jbo>le gasnu</jbo> might reflect the Ergative Case better since the goal-orientation...ness of an event can be handled by the Version. The Processual Version states that no goal of the act is taken into account, the process is not described as having the end.</lojban>

### ABS Absolutive

<description><this this>THIS</this> plays the role of patient. [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) might not be present in <this context>CONTEXT</this>.</description>

> A coin fell from above.

> *[Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive) fell from above.*

<lojban><jbo>[ABS-argument] jai se gasnu</jbo> == <jbo>tu'a [ABS-argument] se gasnu</jbo> where <jbo>tu'a ko'a</jbo> == <jbo>le su'u co'e ko'a</jbo></lojban>

<lojban><jbo>[ABS-argument] jai se rinka</jbo></lojban>

<lojban><jbo>[ABS-argument] jai se bapli</jbo></lojban>

<lojban><jbo>ERG gasnu le su'u co'e ABS</jbo></lojban>

<lojban>Interestingly <jbo>le rinka</jbo> is an abstraction. Whereas <jbo>le gasnu</jbo> is an object. If sumti-raising were always allowed in Lojban then we would have <jbo>rinka fi zi'o == gasnu</jbo></lojban>

### Combination of [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) and [Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive)

> 1. I drove the car fast.

> 2. The car went fast.

<description>The two sentences show different focus. In Ithkuil dropping [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative)-labeled formative changes the meaning from 1. to 2.</description>

<lojban>omit <jbo>gasnu</jbo> or derived verbs</lojban>

<lojban>use <jbo>zi'o</jbo></lojban>

### ACT Activative

<description><this this>THIS</this> is engaged in a <this context>[Modality](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/verbs/#modality) CONTEXT</this> state of creating a currently unrealized situation that may realize at some step.</description>

> You should go home.

> I need some rest.

> I want you to stop.

> I was expecting them to settle down.

> I ask you to stay.

<lojban>by default many places have implicit <jbo>da'i</jbo>/<jbo>ju'anai</jbo>. nitcu, sarcu, djica, bilga, kanpe, pacna, cpedu, minde, troci, djusku</lojban>

### EFF Effectuative

<description><this this>THIS</this> creates a chain of events.</description>

<lojban><jbo>EFF jai rinka ko'e</jbo> == <jbo>tu'a EFF rinka ko'e</jbo> i.e. EFF is an argument of <jbo>co'e</jbo> predicate that effects (rinka)-event of <jbo>ko'e</jbo>.</lojban>

<lojban><jbo>le curmi</jbo>, the role of enabler.</lojban>

### DER Derivative

<description><this this>THIS</this> is a force or natural events (e.g. tsunami, breeze).</description>

<description>marks events that cause something relevant.</description>

<lojban><jbo>rinka</jbo>, <jbo>bapli</jbo>, <jbo>zunti</jbo></lojban>

<lojban>notice <jbo>spuda</jbo>/<jbo>frati</jbo> for another argument of the same clause</lojban>

### SIT Situative

<description><this this>THIS</this> forms a shadow context for <this another>ANOTHER</this> clause. It doesn't imply any agency/patiency relationships with the event of the clause.</description>

> Due to cold weather we won't go to school today.

> In the presence of criminal elements we can't expect any desire for higher education.

> With the help of this app we will get there soon.

### AFF Affective

<description><this this>THIS</this> plays the role of experiencer in <this context>CONTEXT</this>, <this this>THIS</this> is in a state not requiring will. If <this this>THIS</this> induced the state then [Inducive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#ind-inducive) is to be used instead.

> I was surprised.

> The child is about to sleep.

## Possessive cases

### POS Possessive

<description><this this>THIS</this> alienably possesses <this another>ANOTHER</this>.
