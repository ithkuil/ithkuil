# Cases

<lojban>It would be nice to find at least one preposition for each case (xe cukta, te fukpi, etc. are too long in this regard, whereas <jbo>xebe'i</jbo> and <jbo>veka'a</jbo> are yummy). But I'm not sure that the language has all the cases that we might need. Who knows, one may decide that we need 1342 cases. Now what? Its own preposition for each predicate place?</lojban>

## Transrelative Cases

<description>Almost half of the world's languages have [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative)-[Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive) structure. Another half has nominative-accusative structure. So two duads. It's interesting that [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) and [Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive) are not two parts of a duad in Ithkuil but instead just two cases among many others.</description>

### OBL Oblique

<description><this this>THIS</this> plays the role of content.</description>

> It's a present from my grandmother.

> This is what I want.

> The floor is made of stone ([Oblique](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#obl-oblique)).

### ERG Ergative

<description><this this>THIS</this> plays the role of agent.</description>

<description><this this>THIS</this> agent, while having some will, starts an act of <this context>CONTEXT</this> resulting in some change of properties in <this another>ANOTHER [Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive)</this>.</description>

> The dog bit the man.

> *[Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) bit the man.*

> The policeman forced the criminal to stop.

> *[Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) forced [Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive) to stop.*

<lojban><jbo>le gasnu</jbo>, <jbo>le zukte</jbo></lojban>

<lojban><jbo>le gasnu</jbo> might reflect the Ergative Case better since the goal-orientation...ness of an event can be handled by the Version. The Processual Version states that no goal of the act is taken into account; the process is not described as having the end.</lojban>

### ABS Absolutive

<description><this this>THIS</this> plays the role of patient. [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) might not be present in <this context>CONTEXT</this>.</description>

> A coin fell from above.

> *[Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive) fell from above.*

<lojban><jbo>[ABS-argument] jai se gasnu</jbo> == <jbo>tu'a [ABS-argument] se gasnu</jbo> where <jbo>tu'a ko'a</jbo> == <jbo>le su'u co'e ko'a</jbo></lojban>

<lojban><jbo>[ABS-argument] jai se rinka</jbo></lojban>

<lojban><jbo>[ABS-argument] jai se bapli</jbo></lojban>

<lojban><jbo>ERG gasnu le su'u co'e ABS</jbo></lojban>

<lojban>Interestingly, <jbo>le rinka</jbo> is an abstraction, whereas <jbo>le gasnu</jbo> is an object. If sumti-raising were always allowed in Lojban, then we would have <jbo>rinka fi zi'o == gasnu</jbo></lojban>

### Combination of [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative) and [Absolutive](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#abs-absolutive)

> 1. I drove the car fast.

> 2. The car went fast.

<description>The two sentences show different focus. In Ithkuil, dropping [Ergative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/cases/#erg-ergative)-labeled formative changes the meaning from 1. to 2.</description>

<lojban>Omit <jbo>gasnu</jbo> or derived verbs.</lojban>

### ACT Activative

> I ask you to stay.

### EFF Effectuative

<description><this this>THIS</this> creates a chain of events.</description>

<lojban><jbo>EFF jai rinka ko'e</jbo> == <jbo>tu'a EFF rinka ko'e</jbo> i.e., EFF is an argument of <jbo>co'e</jbo> predicate that effects (rinka)-event of <jbo>ko'e</jbo>.</lojban>

<lojban>Notice <jbo>spuda</jbo>/<jbo>frati</jbo> for another argument of the same clause.</lojban>

### SIT Situative
