## Affiliation

### CSL Consolidative

<description>members of <this this>THIS</this> set have no design or purpose and occur non-artificially, naturally as members of <this this>THIS</this> set. Individual members of <this this>THIS</this> set would use [Consolidative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/basic/#csl-consolidative) and [Uniplex](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/basic/#uni-uniplex) thus denoting no inherent purpose.</description>

- a grove
- leaves of the plant
- raindrops from the cloud
- The rock has always been here even before the road was built.
- I turned my head toward the tree and unexpectedly saw something there.

### ASO Associative

<description>members of <this this>THIS</this> set share the same purpose.</description>

- an orchard
- identical screwdrivers
- But this rock is a road sign.
- I turned my head toward the noise from the tree and saw not a cat as I expected but a crow.

### VAR Variative

<description>at least one member of <this this>THIS</this> has purposes different from purposes of other members of <this this>THIS</this>.</description>

- People of different backgrounds appeared in the same square by chance.
- a mixture of overlapping voices saying different things
- My appearance had several unrelated consequences.

### COA Coalescent

<description>members of <this this>THIS</this> set have a mutual synergy relationship to each other. Duplex is usually combined with Coalescent.</description>

- a complete toolset for fixing cars
- a seven-course meal
- my eyes
- I worked out a plan of fighting the fire

## Perspective

### M Monadic

<description><this this>THIS</this> is an entity as a psychologically single whole through time or space even if <this this>THIS</this> consists of elements or has inner structure or can change in time or space. For verbs <this this>THIS</this> denotes events having at least one part under consideration or in <this context>CONTEXT</this> where <this speaker>SPEAKER</this> is present.</description>

- It's a lake.

- The tree grows.

### U Unbounded

<description><this this>THIS</this> is an entity where not all of its elements under consideration are in <this context>CONTEXT</this>, <this this>THIS</this> may be in several separated spatial or temporal intervals, some of which are not accessible in <this context>CONTEXT</this>.</description>

- Alice here and The Rabbit there.

- A stump of a tree (what used to be a tree).

### N Gnomic

<description><this this>THIS</this> contains all its possible members from all spatial and temporal intervals.</description>

- She is a good sportsperson.

- Gravitation makes all sandwiches fall down.

### A Abstract

<description><this this>THIS</this> is an abstraction of events.</description>

- The crucifixion of Jesus considered as a downhill bicycle race.

- The idea of everything having to do with dogs.

- Experience of being a child.

- Dancing.

## Extension

<!--

Some examples of extension to show how I believe Inceptive is when you approach a concept and Attenuative is when you withdraw from a concept, whereas Graduative is when a concept approaches you and Depletive is when a concept withdraws from you:

   Temporal   |     Spacial      |   Spaciotemporal   |
PRX lifestage | part of the lake | instance of growth |
ICP be born   | outer shore      | start of growing   |
GRA mature    | deepening lake   | increased growing  |
DPL grow old  | shallowing lake  | decreased growing  |
(TRM)/ATV die | inner shore      | end of growing     |
   Temporal   |     Spacial      |   Spaciotemporal   |
PRX daytime   | cavern section   | light traveling    |
ICP morning   | entrance/front   | light from source  |
GRA dawn      | verge/brink      | brightening/shine  |
DPL dusk      | outskirt/limit   | darkening/dim      |
ATV evening   | exit/back/end    | light at target    |
Depletive does not necessarily indicate the complete undoing or retrogression of an entity, just the instance where it fades out or slows down, which can occur in the middle of whatever it is/whatever it is doing, not just at the boundaries. Same goes for Graduative. Like gleki said, these are like a progressive aspect of what 'currently' or 'locally' changes. Still, they work for both Stative and Dynamic entities. I guess 'increasing' and 'decreasing' work in place of 'development' and 'regression'. Ultimately, the approaching/withdrawing metaphor is an attempt to make extension simpler to understand. PRX is a static context and entity, ICP and ATV are a changing context, and GRA and DPL are a changing entity.-->
