## Affiliation

### CSL Consolidative

<description>members of this set have no design or purpose and occur non-artificially, naturally as members of this set. Individual members of this set would use [Consolidative](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/basic/#csl-consolidative) and [Uniplex](https://ithkuil.github.io/ithkuil/basic/#uni-uniplex) thus denoting no inherent purpose.</description>

- a grove
- leaves of the plant
- raindrops from the cloud
- The rock has always been here even before the road was built.
- I turned my head toward the tree and unexpectedly saw something there.

### ASO Associative

<description>members of this set share the same purpose.</description>

- an orchard
- identical screwdrivers
- But this rock is a road sign.
- I turned my head toward the noise from the tree and saw not a cat as I expected but a crow.

### VAR Variative

<description>at least one member of this set has purposes different from purposes of other members of this set.</description>

- People of different backgrounds appeared in the same square by chance.
- a mixture of overlapping voices saying different things
- My appearance had several unrelated consequences.

### COA Coalescent

<description>members of this set have a mutual synergy relationship to each other. Duplex is usually combined with Coalescent.</description>

- a complete toolset for fixing cars
- a seven-course meal
- my eyes
- I worked out a plan of fighting the fire

## Perspective

### M Monadic

<description>This is an entity as a psychologically single whole through time or space even if it consists of elements or has inner structure or can change in time or space. For verbs this denotes events having at least one part under consideration or in context where the speaker is present.</description>

- It's a lake.
- The tree grows.

### U Unbounded

<description>This is an entity where not all of its elements under consideration are in context, this may be in several separated spatial or temporal intervals, some of which are not accessible in context.</description>

- Alice here and The Rabbit there.
- A stump of a tree (what used to be a tree).

### N Gnomic

<description>This contains all its possible members from all spatial and temporal intervals.</description>

- She is a good sportsperson.
- Gravitation makes all sandwiches fall down.

### A Abstract

<description>This is an abstraction of events.</description>

- The crucifixion of Jesus considered as a downhill bicycle race.
- The idea of everything having to do with dogs.
- Experience of being a child.
- Dancing.

## Extension

<!--

Some examples of extension to show how I believe Inceptive is when you approach a concept and Attenuative is when you withdraw from a concept, whereas Graduative is when a concept approaches you and Depletive is when a concept withdraws from you:

   Temporal   |     Spacial      |   Spaciotemporal   |
PRX lifestage | part of the lake | instance of growth |
ICP be born   | outer shore      | start of growing   |
GRA mature    | deepening lake   | increased growing  |
DPL grow old  | shallowing lake  | decreased growing  |
(TRM)/ATV die | inner shore      | end of growing     |
   Temporal   |     Spacial      |   Spaciotemporal   |
PRX daytime   | cavern section   | light traveling    |
ICP morning   | entrance/front   | light from source  |
GRA dawn      | verge/brink      | brightening/shine  |
DPL dusk      | outskirt/limit   | darkening/dim      |
ATV evening   | exit/back/end    | light at target    |
Depletive does not necessarily indicate the complete undoing or retrogression of an entity, just the instance where it fades out or slows down, which can occur in the middle of whatever it is/whatever it is doing, not just at the boundaries. Same goes for Graduative. Like gleki said, these are like a progressive aspect of what 'currently' or 'locally' changes. Still, they work for both Stative and Dynamic entities. I guess 'increasing' and 'decreasing' work in place of 'development' and 'regression'. Ultimately, the approaching/withdrawing metaphor is an attempt to make extension simpler to understand. PRX is a static context and entity, ICP and ATV are a changing context, and GRA and DPL are a changing entity.

### DEL Delimitive

<description>This is an entity with its spatial or temporal borders and without implying it to have any structure.</description>

- Take a car to get there (no parts of the car are in consideration).
- He jogs every Sunday (no stages of running are important)

### PRX Proximal

<description>This is a part/subset/property of THIS-UNDECORATED entity without taking into consideration further parts/subsets/properties of THIS-UNDECORATED. Uses the whole event to denote a part if it (raising).</description>

- He hit me in the head.
- I used the toilet paper (probably not all of it)

### ICP Inceptive

<description>This is a closest, beginning border of THIS-UNDECORATED entity (raising).</description>

- Alice looked into the rabbit hole.
- He came from the forest (the expanse of the forest)

### TRM Terminative

<description>This is a farthest, terminal, least accessible border of THIS-UNDECORATED entity (raising).</description>

- We are out of money.
- Finally, he arrived at the hotel.

### GRA Graduative

<description>This is a closest, beginning border of THIS-UNDECORATED entity (raising) where the border is fuzzy, fades away or poorly understood.</description>

- The darkness that had come in from the Mediterranean covered the city so detested by the procurator.
- It became colder and colder.

### DPL Depletive

<description>This is a farthest, terminal, least accessible border of THIS-UNDECORATED entity (raising) where the border is fuzzy, fades away or poorly understood.</description>

- There is not much time left.
- The salt dissolved in water.
- The music faded away.
- The language community died slowly.
- They were the last of the Mohicans.

## Context

### EXS Existential

- There were birds and monkeys sitting there (no attitude toward the scene or use of the scene is implied)

### FNC Functional

<description>This is THIS-UNDECORATED as viewed personally important or within social CONTEXT in its purpose, value or attitude towards it.</description>

### RPS Representational

<description>This is a symbol having the same meaning as THIS-UNDECORATED through a metaphorical transfer or raising.</description>

- White collars demand a lot.

### AMG Amalgamative

<description>This is THIS-UNDECORATED in totality of the history, historical attitude and use of THIS concept.</description>

## Designation

### IFL Informal

<description>This is an in-place understanding of THIS-UNDECORATED.</description>

### FML Formal

<description>This is a permanent understanding of THIS-UNDECORATED.</description>

### Comparison

- revered thing, idol
- eat, have a meal
- tools, equipment
- pit, moat
- pit where water persists, water reservoir
- success, prosperity

## Essence

<description>Essence creates mental scopes or labels.</description>

> The rabbit that ran away from Alice didn't run away from Alice

> In fact, the Rabbit had his own business and was just in a hurry passing by.

The sentence 1. in isolation is self-contradicting.

> The woman you can see is a man.

> _What you describe-as/imagine-to-be a woman is a man._

> The wall around the neighboring city is high.

> _The wall around the neighboring city is said to be high. I assume it's high._

### NRM Normal

<description>This is really what THIS-UNDECORATED means in global CONTEXT. Real-world entity, what really is ...</description>

- You are coming.

### RPV Representative

<description>This is described as THIS-UNDECORATED. Scoped entity.</description>

- You must come to the party (but haven't yet).

<lojban>Possibly scoped subgraph labeled by da'i/se'o or other UI. ti'e, ba'a, ja'o can be used for describing unexperienced features</lojban>
<lojban>If understood as labeling then le [VERB] or ko'a voi [CLAUSE] is to be used.</lojban>
